There are two basic data files needed for appyling this ML pipeline: a meta-data containing csv file, plus a read count containing csv file. Instructions for constructing the count file are listed here and scripts can be found at the same repository, while the meta-data must be curated manually considering the required experiments, according to each one purpose. 
1) "Salmon" fastq files. 
2) Get all .sf files from each directory. 
3) Give format. 
4) Join data.
5) Apply PCA and biplot algorithms. 

Issues with the functioning of the scripts can be personally disscused with the author. Please feel free to comment or suggest any improval.
